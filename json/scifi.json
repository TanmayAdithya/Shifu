As a serpent sheds its withered skin, so the season bids adieu the fading woes and triumphs of past with procession of passing pigments and aerial promenade of lilted fronds. In decay comes forth a vibrant vigor of breath anew. Gaze onward, dear traveller, and marvel in the wonders tomorrow brings.

It has been a rough time especially since I've never broken a bone before, so everything is new to me. All in all, I'm grateful and have been resting and recovering. It could have been much worse. Even while in recovery, I'm so excited for Futurescapes and moving into the fall season. So I wanted to still make something for you all! Feuille Morte (meaning Dead Leaf) is a simple video that I made while having only one working arm haha I can't work at my regular speed and I don't know how long it will be before I'm back to normal but I'm excited to share more videos and music with you this season! Happy fall and stay safe!\n\nPlease help my channel by sharing, liking, commenting and subscribing!\n\nSee you in the next one!\n\nüéß A collection of Futurescapes music and digital wallpapers are available at: futurescapes-scifiambience.bandcamp.com\n\n‚úèÔ∏è My music is not free to use.

Voices from deep within the forest called forth a desperate invitation as he mustered the courage to move on. Though a harrowing journey lay ahead, he knew the heart of this dangerous woodland kept hidden the answers to saving his dying home.\n___________________________\n\nAs many of you know, my full time work is composing music for video games. This video is the first of what I have wanted to include on Futurescapes since I started the channel. As a video game composer, I write in many different styles, genres and emotions beyond that of classic space and science fiction. One of my favourites is that of story driven adventure games often found in the indie scene. Games like the Ori series, Journey, RiME, Gris and so much more. I hope you enjoy this glimpse into other aspects of my composing!

As she approached the Alchemy building, its form came into view through the morning's comforting blanket of dense fog. Her occupation had not been one of glamour but of simplicity, her regrets only formed by the immense distance she now felt from her home planet. \"One day I'll have enough money to retire and return home...\" she thought longingly. The building's bell tolled to signify the beginning of another work day.\n\nPlease help my channel by sharing, liking, commenting and subscribing!\n\nSee you in the next one!\n\nüéß A collection of Futurescapes music and digital wallpapers are available at: futurescapes-scifiambience.bandcamp.com\n\n‚úèÔ∏è My music is not free to use.

Ever since I was a child I idolized The Great Heroes that went before us. Like superstars they would board the ship of their launch year with the rest of their crew, waving to an overjoyed barrage of cameras and reportermen. I never thought I would get the chance to follow in their footsteps, yet here I am. I said farewell to my crewmates just three suns ago. Five members, sent to pave the way for future colonization on five of the most habitable planets in the galaxy. If my efforts prove fruitful (and the planet survivable), I may receive colony members within three to five Earth years. Until then I build, forage and research. Doing everything in my power to establish a veritable home for our kind. This is my duty, my calling. For I, am A Voyager.\n\nPlease help my channel by sharing, liking, commenting and subscribing!\n\nSee you in the next one!\n\nüéß A collection of Futurescapes music and digital wallpapers are available at: futurescapes-scifiambience.bandcamp.com\n\n‚úèÔ∏è My music is not free to use.

The fabric of space appears to be physically fluctuating at astronomical rates, causing structural damage to the ship's interior walls as they buckle under immense pressure from the outside. Crew members have begun experiencing hallucinatory events of unexplainable intensity. It is unclear as to whether these events are forgeries of the mind, visions of what lies beyond The Rift, or attempts of communication from an unknown source. Log recordings will continue as I or the crew are alive and able. We pray that entry into The Rift will reveal to us answers that benefit the future of mankind. This concludes the entry of log 237.\n\nPlease help my channel by sharing, liking, commenting and subscribing!\n\nSee you in the next one!\n\nüéß A collection of Futurescapes music and digital wallpapers are available at: futurescapes-scifiambience.bandcamp.com\n\n‚úèÔ∏è My music is not free to use.

And though the townspeople loathed the oppressive eye of The Federation, they meekly returned to their homesteads in the quaint outer regions of The Capital, lest they be found galavanting past curfew in the land they call home. An air of anxiety emanates through the atmosphere as leaders of The Federation teeter on the brink of war, waving their juvenile fingers towards anyone that dare trod in their almighty, self glorifying way. Even as leaders of The Federation drive The Capital toward demise with the mental acumen of a rancid rotting watermeal, amity remains among the people, unifying them in a humble harmony only known to those of the oppressed, outcast and tyrannized.\n\nPlease help my channel by sharing, liking, commenting and subscribing!\n\nSee you in the next one!\n\nüéß A collection of Futurescapes music and digital wallpapers are available at: futurescapes-scifiambience.bandcamp.com\n\n‚úèÔ∏è My music is not free to use.

Food and drink are NOT guaranteed toxin and radiation free. NO ghouls allowed. Companions welcome.\n\n_________________________________\n\nThis video is inspired by the Fallout game series in light of the awesome new Prime series! The Fallout series (specifically Fallout 3) has been at the top of my favourites list since its release. I remember renting it from Blockbuster (lol Blockbuster, good times) and spending the entire weekend playing through the whole game. I was absolutely obsessed with the world that was created (thanks to inspiration from the original 2 games, no doubt). Everything from The Wasterland and post apocalyptic societies to the retro aesthetic and vintage jazz music. This video is intentionally made to capture the essence of Fallout 3 and the way Inon Zur's music compliments with sparse thematic elements that fill the vast emptiness of The Wasteland in an unforgettable sound. Pair that with radioactive wind and old radio music and you've got yourself the essence of the Fallout series.\n\nPlease help my channel by sharing, liking, commenting and subscribing!\n\nSee you in the next one!\n\nüéß A collection of Futurescapes music and digital wallpapers are available at: futurescapes-scifiambience.bandcamp.com\n\n‚úèÔ∏è My music is not free to use.

These relaxing videos are so fun and rewarding for me to make and I love finding interesting new worlds to create. I've published a bunch of long form videos, shorts, released music and wallpapers on Bandcamp, and as of writing this have just hit 17,000 subscribers!

He scarsely caught his weary breath as nostalgic visions took hold and rendered images of his kin‚Äôs tranquil life. From the pit of his being he welled with a putrid dread at the scene of their massacre, unfairly laid to rest at the calamitous hands of The Oradel. With a deep withering exhale he admired the sight a final time, turned towards The Outlands and began his journey.\n\nPlease help my channel by sharing, liking, commenting and subscribing!\n\nSee you in the next one!\n\nüéß A collection of Futurescapes music and digital wallpapers are available at: futurescapes-scifiambience.bandcamp.com\n\n‚úèÔ∏è My music is not free to use.
