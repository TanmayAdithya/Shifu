        "description": "3 Hours of waterfall sounds at Skogafoss, located on the southern coast of Iceland. During my travels of Iceland I made as stop Skogafoss to record the sounds of flowing waterfall as well as the Skógá River. I started recording this ambience early in the morning. I've done recording similar to this a few years ago, but this is coldest it's ever been and the longest recording I've done here.

        "description": "Rainy day in New York City's Times Square, captured through an open window with a binaural audio soundscape, from Day to Night. This video was filmed in Manhattan, New York, on a cloudy and rainy day. The audio is authentic, not looped, and recorded in real-time to give you the most authentic experience possible. Making this video required significant effort, but I'm excited about creating more in the future. The recording captures a blend of sirens, construction noises, people, traffic sounds, and more. Your support is appreciated.

I've always found it beautiful the way the mountains and sky reflect off of the wet black sand along with the ocean waves. I actually prefer this beach to Reynisfjara. Although Reynisfjara is very stunning as well, just a lot more dangerous. Enjoy!

It's always been a destination that I've wanted to explore, specifically the Old Town of Krakow. It was wonderful to arrive and witness the Old City of Krakow covered in snow, as well as explore the illuminated streets at night. This is more of an aimless walk just exploring the winter nightlife, as I had just arrived and needed more time to properly get accommodated in a new city. \n\nThe locals have been exceptionally kind, and I am sincerely grateful to everyone who has personally shared their city with me. This ambient stroll captures the sounds of snowfall, people, Christmas music, horses, and more. This video has been filmed with binaural 3D audio for a more immersive experience. Enjoy! Have a good day!\n\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/nomadicambience\nVideo LUTS - https://www.patreon.com/nomadicambience/shop\nFor Ambience Sounds and Music - https://share.epidemicsound.com/lfkdnw\n\nSocial Media\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/nomadicambience/\nTiktok - @nomadicambience\n\nPlaces You Can Find Me\nSpotify\nApple Music \n\nPlaylists\nRain Walks - https://bit.ly/3p5FRJx\nSounds for Sleep - http://bit.ly/3kjioqD\nSounds New York - http://bit.ly/3iEFYgQ\nSounds of Iceland - http://bit.ly/35LFR7R\nSounds of Japan - https://bit.ly/2TZ7sOj\nSounds of Norway - http://bit.ly/3kiprQc\nCafe Sounds - http://bit.ly/2JW8tCq\nNature Sounds - https://bit.ly/3l5SVMy\nCity Sounds - https://bit.ly/2I3I47U\nOcean Waves Sounds - http://bit.ly/2ygmPaj\nRain and Thunderstorms - https://bit.ly/353w6DV\n\nEverything in the video is filmed and recorded on location.\n\nDo not copy, reproduce, or distribute any of the content.\n\n#poland #christmas #asmr",

This was originally a throw away video because I had such a similar snowfall video about a year ago so I decided to never upload this one. I preferred the former video as you had a nice view of the Alps, but less snowfall. This video actually has much more snowfall, but not the visuals I was hoping for. While I was back in the States I decided to go through hard drives of videos that I never shared publicly. This audio consist of river sounds from the Mattervispa as well as city sounds and snowfall and birds.  Sounds can be used for sleep, study and meditation.

It's just a very long recording of the cityscape of tokyo that features sounds of people, city traffic, dogs, birds, wind, and more. I do apologize as some parts of the audio may not be in sync with the video. That is due to all of the copyright music that interferes with the recording and also making YT happy. Those portions had to be replaced with still authentic audio recorded at a different moment. I record some of these sounds just for chilling out or study. I don't recommend sleeping to this as there are moments with loud sirens and construction. Thank you for your support.
